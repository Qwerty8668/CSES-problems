# CSES PROBLEMS

This repository contains my solutions to selected algorithmic problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/), implemented in **C++**.   

## Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to a single CSES problem.
- Problems are divided into folders, same as sections on the website.
- Filenames match the problem names (e.g., `weird_algorithm.cpp`).

## Requirements
- **C++17** (or newer) compiler.

## Compilation & Usage
Example for `weird_algorithm.cpp`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall weird_algorithm.cpp -o weird_algorithm
./weird_algorithm
